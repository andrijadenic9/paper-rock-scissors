# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

Welcome to the ***Rock, Paper, Scissors*** game application! Test your strategy and luck in this classic game of chance against the computer.

## Gameplay

In the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, you'll compete against the computer by selecting one of the three available options: rock, paper, or scissors. Here's how the game works:

- Rock crushes scissors.
- Scissors cuts paper.
- Paper covers rock.

Each round, you and the computer choose one option simultaneously. The outcomes are as follows:

- If you win (your choice beats the computer's choice), you earn 1 point.
- If you lose (the computer's choice beats your choice), the computer earns 1 point.
- If both you and the computer choose the same option, no points are awarded.

The game continues until one of the players reaches a score of 5 points, declaring them the winner.
